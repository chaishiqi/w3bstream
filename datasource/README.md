## Contributing

We welcome contributions to expand the range of Data Availability implementations supported by W3bstream. If you have developed a new implementation, please follow these steps to contribute:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a personal copy of the repository by forking it.
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your implementation.
3. **Implement and Test**: Develop your implementation and ensure it passes all tests.
4. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Once your implementation is complete, submit a PR to the main repository.

We will review your PR and merge it upon approval. Thank you for contributing to W3bstream!
